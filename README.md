Hector:

Kenny: Helped Hector install and set up WSL2 for establishing a testing environment for our code on Ubuntu. Created source code files for the server, client and main (chat.c). Also set up the GitHub repository to save and keep track of our changes to the files.
Hector:  My contribution to this project was to create the rest of the c files and/or .h files so we can have a working product at the end of the day! Lastly, it was a great experience to create a project like this and I could not have ask for a better teammate.
